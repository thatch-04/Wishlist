## Future Updates

**Wishlist Sharing** - Give users the ability to see other users' wishlists without being able to add to, edit, or remove items from wishlists not belonging to the user.

**Wishlist Coordination** - Allow users to coordinate items to purchase from a user's wishlist by marking items on the list as purchased. This should allow other users to see the items marked purchased but the user who owns the list should not be able to see which of their items are marked as purchased.
